# Easy-Blog-Setup

This repository and initial instructions are modified from a [repo by Chad Baldwin](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html)

**Git** - a version control software
**Github** - an online platform for hosting and collaborating on git repositories (basically folders with files you want to keep track of)

Requirements:
- Github account
- Basic understanding of Markdown syntax (or you can use HTML if you know that)
    - [R Markdown reference guide](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf?_ga=2.243129861.649238065.1666362515-276851843.1648675901)
    - Blog uses [github's markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) which is pretty similar
- (Optional) Use of R Markdown via RStudio
- (Optional) Connecting github with RStudio
    - [Install git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html)
    - [Configure your computer with your git account](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html)
    - The first time you create a repository in RStudio from version control and try to push up the changes you make, it should prompt you to log-in via a browser, setting up the rest of what you need.  If not there is much more information [here](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)
