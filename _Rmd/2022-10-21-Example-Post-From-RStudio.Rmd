```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
#Run this code in your **console**
rmarkdown::render(input = "_Rmd/2022-10-21-Example-Post-From-RStudio.Rmd", 
                  output_dir = '_posts/', 
                  output_options = list(html_preview = FALSE))
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "../img/")
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
```

## Cool Research Project

Description of how awesome it is.  Maybe some code that does something to demonstrate.

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(iris))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width = '550px'}
GGally::ggpairs(iris, aes(color = Species))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
